      <description>Starting a blog Starting a blog has always been a daunting task for me. Not only because it requires sharing my personal experiences, but also because I want it to be a blog that will be easy for me to write and easy for you to read.
I am making a simple blog, so most of the posts will be simply text with some code snippets and possibly some figures.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since Electron has been created a lot has been discussed about the
practicality of using &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14245183&#34;&gt;it for powering desktop applications&lt;/a&gt;.
Electron-based apps tend to have high CPU usage and even higher memory usage,
easily taking gigabytes of RAM.They reduce battery life and generally make
your PC feel like an electric typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>My name is Dimitar and I am creating the user interface middleware for your next game at Coherent Labs.
This is my blog about software development and includes my notes from this rally - from an idea to a product. Topics range from coding, mostly in C++, through practices to management.
You can reach me via email, Twitter, GitHib.</description>
